The FAS Incoterm is a suitable choice for buyers who have the necessary infrastructure to move the goods from the port of departure to its destination, as the seller is not responsible for any additional costs or risks associated with the shipment. This term also implies that the seller is responsible for all export customs formalities, including the payment of export duties and taxes. However, the FAS term is not suitable for goods that require special handling or require special packing, or if the buyer requires the goods to be shipped to a specific destination. In such cases, the CIF or FOB Incoterms should be used instead.
