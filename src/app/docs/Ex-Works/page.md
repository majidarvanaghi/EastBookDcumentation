EXW, short for “Ex Works,” places most responsibility with the buyer. The seller is expected to have the goods ready for collection at the agreed place of delivery (commonly the seller’s factory, mill, plant or warehouse). The buyer is accountable for all subsequent costs and risk, including all export procedures, starting with loading the goods onto a transport vehicle at the seller’s premises.

In practice, it is not uncommon for a seller to load goods onto the vehicle instead, at the risk and cost of the buyer—or even free of charge. However, such an agreement must be made within the contract of sales.

### Bottom Line

For a buyer, entering into an Ex Works shipping agreement can be risky and time-consuming, adding to the workload. However, if the buyer has adequate knowledge and suitable organization and connections, they can save money with the Ex Works arrangement. For the seller, the Ex Works agreement can be a good choice, as it saves the seller from the majority of the risk and responsibility. The only negative to this is that the seller will miss out on their commission from the shipping company.
