CFR is intended only for transporting goods by sea or inland waterway. Supplier pays export duty, packaging the goods and transportation of the cargo to the port, loads the goods on board, hires and pays the ship and provides the relevant documentation. Recipient unloads the vessel, delivers the goods to the destination, insures the goods, pays import duty, relevant certificates, licenses, etc. CFR is designed to transport goods in bulk or in containers, and also for transportation of heavy equipment.

## Bottom Line

The CFR rule, like the CIP, CPT and CIF rules, imposes basic costs on the seller. The obligations in this rule are also relatively similar to the obligations of the seller in the FOB rule. There is, however, a fundamental difference between them. In the case of the Incoterms CFR rule, the seller is responsible for transport. It means that the exporter finds the carrier, negotiates the appropriate contract and pays for the transport. In addition, it is recommended to use CPT rule if more than one mode of transport is used.
